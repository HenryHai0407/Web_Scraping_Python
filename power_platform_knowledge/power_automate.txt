1. Refine the Excel source

Make sure the sheet is an official Excel Table with headers exactly “henkilön nimi” and “henkilön sähköposti”.

Store the file in SharePoint or OneDrive so Power Automate’s Excel connector can read it.

2. Build the skeleton flow in Power Automate

Trigger: start with a manual button (easy for testing).

List rows present in a table (Excel Online Business).

Apply to each row. Inside the loop add:

Place-holder “Check user” action (dummy Compose that we will swap for the real Tampuuri GET once we know the endpoint).

Condition → if “user does not exist” → call a dummy “Create user” action; else log “Exists”.

Update a row (optional) to record status.

3. Set up secure variables

Create environment variables (or Key Vault secrets) now—even if they’re empty—so we can drop in the real API key / tenant ID later without touching every action.

4. Prepare a quick test plan

Two fake rows in Excel → run the flow → expect “Exists” for both until the real API is wired.

When credentials arrive, flip the dummy steps to real HTTP actions and re-test.

5. Gather the missing information (the five bullets above).

Send your revised Finnish question (duplicate-focused) plus the extra clarifying questions.

Once you have the endpoint, auth details, and required fields, the dummy steps can be converted in 10–15 minutes.
